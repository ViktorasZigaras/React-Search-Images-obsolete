Intro

The
 main idea of this application is to test potential employee of his or her’s abilities to implement a simple image search application by using
unsplash.com
 API. Potential candidate should create free developer account on the specified API page and is able to retrieve images to later use them in below described web application. This task also includes a bonus task which asks a candidate to implement Redux state
 management module.
Main
 task by subtasks:


    Create a web application
     with ReactJS, web application should:


        Be one-page web
         application


        Have a clear, comprehensible
         and responsive layout


        Implement
        unsplash.com
         image retrieval API


        User should be
         able to search images by entered keywords


    Image app functionality:


        Web application
         should provide user with keyword (search) input field


        When keyword is
         entered user should be able to press search button to retrieve the images


        When images are
         returned app should parse API response and display images in the grid below the search input field


        Application should
         show some sort of progress (loading) indicator while images are being fetched


        If there are no
         images by entered keyword user should see message with relevant information (it could be modal popup or text element in empty image grid)


    Bonus tasks:


        Allow user to query
         images by more than one keyword


        Host your application
         in GitHub Pages


        Use SASS/SCSS to
         upstyle your web application


        Write tests for
         chosen ReactJS component


        Allow user to save
         it’s query in Redux state and list saved queries, so that when pressed that query is repeated again and user gets pictures by saved query


    Project requisites:


        Project source
         code should be stored in GitHub, bitbucket or any other version control platform


        Project should
         have a comprehensible README file


        Project directory
         should be logically structured


        Source code should
         be clean and formatted accordingly


        Extensive comments
         in source code are not desirable, source code should be self explanatory
